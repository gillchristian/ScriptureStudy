                    begins the narrative sequence proper. The referent of the
                    word “beginning” has to be defined from the context since
                    there is no beginning or ending with God.<b>sn</b>
                    <i>In the beginning</i>. The verse refers to the beginning
                    of the world as we know it; it affirms that it is entirely
                    the product of the creation of God. But there are two ways
                    that this verse can be interpreted: (1) It may be taken to
                    refer to the original act of creation with the rest of the
                    events on the days of creation completing it. This would
                    mean that the disjunctive clauses of
                    <a
                      class="bibleref"
                      data-bibleref="Gen.1.2"

                    break the sequence of the creative work of the first day.
                    (2) It may be taken as a summary statement of what the
                    chapter will record, that is,
                    <a
                      class="bibleref"
                      data-bibleref="Gen.1.3-Gen.1.31"
                      href="/passage/?search=Gen.1.3-Gen.1.31&amp;version=NET"

                    >
                    are about God’s creating the world as we know it. If the
                    first view is adopted, then we have a reference here to
                    original creation; if the second view is taken, then Genesis
                    itself does not account for the original creation of matter.
                    To follow this view does not deny that the Bible teaches
                    that God created everything out of nothing (cf.
                    <a
                      class="bibleref"
                      data-bibleref="John.1.3"
                      href="/passage/?search=John.1.3&amp;version=NET"
                      >John 1:3</a
                    >)—it simply says that Genesis is not making that
                    affirmation. This second view presupposes the existence of
                    pre-existent matter, when God said, “Let there be light.”
                    The first view includes the description of the primordial
                    state as part of the events of day one. The following
                    narrative strongly favors the second view, for the
                    “heavens/sky” did not exist prior to the second day of
                    creation (see

                      >v. 8</a
                    >) and “earth/dry land” did not exist, at least as we know
                    it, prior to the third day of creation (see
                    <a

                    <span xml:lang="he">אֱלֹהִים</span> (<i>ʾelohim</i>) is
                    commonly used to indicate plural nouns, but also has other
                    functions such as indicating abstract concepts, or the
                    concrete expression of an abstract concept. For example,
                    Saul is referred to as “lord” with the morpheme that often
                    marks plural, but meaning that he, as king, is the concrete
                    expression of being a “lord.” When referring to the one true
                    God, <span xml:lang="he">אֱלֹהִים</span> (<i>ʾelohim</i>)
                    marks God as the actual expression of deity. And the verb
                    that is used with it is singular. In contrast, when the same
                    form is used as a plural reference to the false gods of the
                    nations, the associated verb is plural. Likely the term was
                    a title for the true God but is used so frequently that it
                    becomes viewed as a name.</span

                    >). The Syriac cognate term means “to brood over; to
                    incubate.” How much of that sense might be attached here is
                    hard to say, but the verb does depict the presence of the
                    Spirit of God moving about mysteriously over the waters,
                    presumably preparing for the acts of creation to follow. If
                    one reads “mighty wind” (cf. NEB) then the verse describes
                    how the powerful wind begins to blow in preparation for the

                    Babylonian creation story <i>Enuma Elish,</i> naming is
                    equal to creating. In the Bible the act of naming, like
                    creating, can be an indication of sovereignty (see

                    <i>The first day</i>. The exegetical evidence suggests the

                    It is true that the word can refer to a longer period of

                    “day,” “night,” “morning,” “evening,” “years,” and
                    “seasons.” Consistency would require sorting out how all

                    used with a numerical adjective, it refers to a literal day.
                    Furthermore, the commandment to keep the sabbath clearly
                    favors this interpretation. One is to work for six days and
                    then rest on the seventh, just as God did when he worked at

                    created entities, not deities. To underscore this the text
                    does not even give them names. If used here, the usual names
                    for the sun and moon [<i>Shemesh</i> and <i>Yarih</i>,
                    respectively] might have carried pagan connotations, so they
                    are simply described as greater and lesser lights. Moreover,
                    they serve in the capacity that God gives them, which would
                    not be the normal function the pagans ascribed to them. They

                    paraphrase it as “God endowed them with fruitfulness” or
                    something similar, for here it refers to God’s giving the
                    animals the capacity to reproduce. The expression “blessed”
                    needs clarification in its different contexts, for it is one
                    of the unifying themes of the Book of Genesis. The divine
                    blessing occurs after works of creation and is intended to
                    continue that work—the word of blessing guarantees success.
                    The word means “to enrich; to endow,” and the most visible
                    evidence of that enrichment is productivity or fruitfulness.
                    See C. Westermann,
                    <i>Blessing in the Bible and the Life of the Church</i>

                    It is not saying that these were rational creatures who
                    heard and obeyed the word; rather, it stresses that
                    fruitfulness in the animal world is a result of the divine
                    decree and not of some pagan cultic ritual for fruitfulness.
                    The repeated emphasis of “be fruitful—multiply—fill” adds to
                    this abundance God has given to life. The meaning is
                    underscored by the similar sounds:

                    heavenly court possess the divine “image” in some way. Since
                    the image is closely associated with rulership, perhaps they
                    share the divine image in that they, together with God and
